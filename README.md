### Hi there 👋 I'm Ash

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a sytem for running large data extracts and reports across submitted XBRL filings
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the very depths of Git by implementing my own version.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a classically trained bass-baritone singer, and act as a choir director for a local musical theatre choir.
- 😄 Pronouns: any/all 🏳️‍🌈 I am agender and asexual
